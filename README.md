<h2>Description</h2>

Goal of this project is to analyze a comprehensive dataset containing information about Pokémon from various generations. 
By examining the relationships between various attributes such as base stats, types, generations, legendary status, and capture rate, we seek to uncover insights that can aid players in making informed decisions when attempting to catch Pokémon efficiently. 
Previous studies have explored various aspects of Pokémon, including the impact of base stats on battle performance, type effectiveness, and evolutionary trends. However, limited research has been conducted specifically on the factors influencing capture rates. From this project we aim to fill that gap by focusing on the capture mechanics and providing a detailed analysis of the variables that contribute to the success of catching Pokémon.
